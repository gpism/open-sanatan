### **A Call to Unite Beyond “-isms” Under the Sanatan Spirit**

The root cause of societal divisions and vulnerabilities has often been the excessive focus on **"-isms"**—rigid ideologies and labels that fragment our collective identity. History has shown that such divisions have weakened us internally, paving the way for foreign invasions and exploitation. It's time to rise above these constructs and unite under **Sanatan Dharma**, the eternal way of living in harmony with truth and the cosmos.

---

### **No Room for Divisions: Follow the Path of True Seekers**

The essence of **Sanatan Dharma** is unity, inclusivity, and self-realization. It calls us to follow the teachings of **true sages, yogis, and seekers**—those deeply immersed in meditation, self-discipline, and spiritual pursuit. Throughout history, enlightened beings have guided humanity toward unity by breaking down societal hierarchies and barriers.

### **The Corruption of the Varna System**

The original **Varna system**, based on **guna (qualities)** and **karma (actions)**, was designed to ensure societal harmony by aligning roles with individual strengths. Over time, it devolved into a rigid, birth-based caste system. This corruption led to:

1. **Exclusion and Oppression:** Weaponization of the system by certain groups to create rigid hierarchies that marginalized others.
2. **Loss of Meritocracy:** Valuing birth over qualities and actions, leading to stagnation and inefficiency.
3. **Fragmentation:** Division into caste-based identities, weakening societal unity.

#### **Historic Implications of the Corruption:**

1. **Weakness During Invasions:**  
   Caste divisions fragmented India’s defense during invasions, such as:
   - The **Turkic and Mughal conquests** exploited internal divisions.
   - The absence of unity led to vulnerabilities that foreign powers capitalized upon.

2. **Colonial Exploitation:**  
   The **British Raj** institutionalized caste divisions to implement "divide and rule" policies, exacerbating societal fragmentation.

3. **Decline in Knowledge:**  
   The Varna system's misuse restricted education and innovation to select groups, disenfranchising large segments of society and stalling progress.

### **Examples from Indian History: Lessons from True Seekers**

- **Adi Shankaracharya (8th Century CE):** Unified India under **Advaita Vedanta**, emphasizing spiritual equality.  
- **Basavanna (12th Century CE):** Rejected caste distinctions, advocating equality and devotion in the **Lingayat movement**.  
- **Ravidas (15th Century CE):** Preached caste-free liberation through devotion and good deeds.  
- **Kabir (15th Century CE):** Criticized divisions and ritualism, promoting inner spirituality and unity.

### **Yogic Culture: A Universal Approach**

In **yogic culture**, there are no rigid castes or labels. Yoga focuses on **sadhana (practice)** and transcends societal constructs. It values:

1. **Sadhana:** Personal spiritual effort.
2. **Gunas:** Qualities like purity (sattva), activity (rajas), and inertia (tamas).
3. **Unity:** Recognition of the divine in every being.

#### **Movements Rejecting Caste:**
- **Shaivism:** Welcomed all through devotion to Shiva (e.g., Nath Sampradaya, Lingayat sect).  
- **Shaktism:** Focused on universal goddess worship, rejecting caste hierarchies.  
- **Vaishnavism:** Saints like **Ramanujacharya** and **Chaitanya Mahaprabhu** emphasized devotion over birth.  
- **Bhakti Movement:** Saints like Mirabai, Tulsidas, and Tukaram spread the message of love and equality.

### **Our Path Forward**

1. **Reject Ritualism Over Spirit:** Move beyond the superficial interpretations propagated by those disconnected from dharma's essence. Let us follow the teachings of genuine practitioners.  
2. **Embrace Unity Under Sanatan Dharma:** Compassion, truth, non-violence, and universal love must be the pillars of a harmonious society.  
3. **Focus on Qualities and Actions:** Merit must triumph over birth-based identities.  
4. **Restore Harmony and Balance:** Through self-realization and spiritual practices, rediscover the unifying core of Sanatan Dharma.
